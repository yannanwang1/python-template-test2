  summary: "\n**Description**\n\n   Machine Learning Fast Tree\n\n**Details**\n\n\
    \   FastTreesRegressor is an implementation of FastRank. FastRank is an efficient\n\
    \   implementation of the MART gradient boosting algorithm. Gradient boosting\
    \ is\n   a machine learning technique for regression problems. It builds each\n\
    \   regression tree in a step-wise fashion, using a predefined loss function to\n\
    \   measure the error for each step and corrects for it in the next. So this\n\
    \   prediction model is actually an ensemble of weaker prediction models. In\n\
    \   regression problems, boosting builds a series of of such trees in a step-wise\n\
    \   fashion and then selects the optimal tree using an arbitrary differentiable\n\
    \   loss function.\n\n   MART learns an ensemble of regression trees, which is\
    \ a decision tree with\n   scalar values in its leaves. A decision (or regression)\
    \ tree is a\n   binary tree-like flow chart, where at each interior node one decides\
    \ which\n   of the two child nodes to continue to based on one of the feature\
    \ values\n   from the input. At each leaf node, a value is returned. In the\n\
    \   interior nodes, the decision is based on the test `\"x <= v\"`, where\n  \
    \ `x` is the value of the feature in the input sample and `v` is one\n   of the\
    \ possible values of this feature. The functions that can be produced\n   by a\
    \ regression tree are all the piece-wise constant functions.\n\n   The ensemble\
    \ of trees is produced by computing, in each step, a regression\n   tree that\
    \ approximates the gradient of the loss function, and adding it to\n   the previous\
    \ tree with coefficients that minimize the loss of the new tree.\n   The output\
    \ of the ensemble produced by MART on a given instance is the sum\n   of the tree\
    \ outputs.\n\n   * In case of a binary classification problem, the output is converted\
    \ to a probability by using some form of calibration. \n\n   * In case of a regression\
    \ problem, the output is the predicted value of the function. \n\n   * In case\
    \ of a ranking problem, the instances are ordered by the output value of the ensemble.\
