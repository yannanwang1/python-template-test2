        supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with

        visibility of ''remoteUser'', a ''certs'' directory is created in the user''s

        home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed

        in that directory. Possible values include: ''CurrentUser'', ''LocalMachine''
