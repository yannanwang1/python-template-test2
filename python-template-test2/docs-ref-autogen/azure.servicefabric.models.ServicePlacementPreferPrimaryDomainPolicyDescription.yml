  summary: "Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service\n\
    where the service's Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a\nparticular\
    \ domain.\nThis placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios\
    \ where\nthe Service Fabric cluster is geographically distributed in order to\n\
    indicate that a service\uFFFDs primary replica should be located in a particular\n\
    fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with\nregional\
    \ or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization\nit is possible\
    \ that the Primary replica may not end up located in this\ndomain due to failures,\
    \ capacity limits, or other constraints.\n.\n"
