  summary: 'Compares the Sequence Number of a property with the SequenceNumber

    argument.  A property''s sequence number can be thought of as that

    property''s version.  Every time the property is modified, its sequence

    number is increased.  The sequence number can be found in a property''s

    metadata.  The comparison fails if the sequence numbers are not equal.

    CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation is generally used as a precondition for

    the write operations in the batch.  Note that if one PropertyBatchOperation

    in a PropertyBatch fails,  the entire batch fails and cannot be committed

    in a transactional manner.
