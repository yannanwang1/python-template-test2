        The Update Job call will fail if you include the poolInfo element and the

        job is not disabled. If you specify an autoPoolSpecification specification

        in the poolInfo, only the keepAlive property can be updated, and then only

        if the auto pool has a poolLifetimeOption of job.

        when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. If omitted, the

        completion behavior is set to noAction. If the current value is

        terminateJob, this is an error because a job''s completion behavior may not

        be changed from terminateJob to noAction. You may not change the value

        from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic

        job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

        request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an

        ''invalid property value'' error response. If you do not specify this

        element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an

        error if the current value is terminatejob. Possible values include:

        ''noAction'', ''terminateJob''
