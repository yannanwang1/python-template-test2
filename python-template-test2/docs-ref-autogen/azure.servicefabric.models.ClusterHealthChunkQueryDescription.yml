        If no filters are specified, no nodes are returned. All the nodes are used

        to evaluate the cluster''s aggregated health state, regardless of the input

        filters.

        The cluster health chunk query may specify multiple node filters.

        For example, it can specify a filter to return all nodes with health state

        Error and another filter to always include a node identified by its

        NodeName.
