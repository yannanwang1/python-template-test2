        health states.

        The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

        states. Only applications that match the filter are returned. All

        applications are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

        If not specified, default value is None, unless the application name or

        the application type name are specified. If the filter has default value

        and application name is specified, the matching application is returned.

        The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a

        combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

        For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches applications with

        HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

        - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

        - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

        return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

        - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

        2.

        - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

        value is 4.

        - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

        value is 8.
