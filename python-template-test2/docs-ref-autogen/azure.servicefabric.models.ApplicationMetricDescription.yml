        This is the maximum Load for an instance of this application on a single

        Fabric will limit the total load of services within the application on

        each node to this value.

        If set to zero, capacity for this metric is unlimited on each node.

        When creating a new application with application capacity defined, the

        product of MaximumNodes and this value must always be smaller than or

        equal to TotalApplicationCapacity.

        When updating existing application with application capacity, the product

        of MaximumNodes and this value must always be smaller than or equal to

        TotalApplicationCapacity.
