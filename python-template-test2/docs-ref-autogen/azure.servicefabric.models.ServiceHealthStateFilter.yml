  summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a service should be included

    as a child of an application in the cluster health chunk.

    The services are only returned if the parent application matches a filter

    specified in the cluster health chunk query description.

    One filter can match zero, one or multiple services, depending on its

    properties.

        If the service doesn''t exist, no service is returned in the cluster health

        chunk based on this filter.

        If the service exists, it is included as the application''s child if the

        health state matches the other filter properties.

        If not specified, all services that match the parent filters (if any) are

        taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members,

        services. It allows selecting services if they match the desired health

        states.

        The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

        states. Only services that match the filter are returned. All services are

        used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

        If not specified, default value is None, unless the service name is

        specified. If the filter has default value and service name is specified,

        the matching service is returned.

        The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a

        combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

        For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches services with

        HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

        - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

        - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

        return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

        - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

        2.

        - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

        value is 4.

        - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

        value is 8.

        - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is

        65535.
