  summary: 'Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service

    where two replicas from the same partition should never be placed in the

    same fault or upgrade domain.

    While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of

    concurrent failures due to unplanned outages or other cases of

    subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider a case where

    replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per

    location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally

    the replica that was placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of

    the remaining datacenters. If this is not desirable then this policy should

    be set.
