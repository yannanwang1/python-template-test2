    - description: 'An action to take on the job containing the task, if

        the task completes with the given exit condition and the job''s

        onTaskFailed property is ''performExitOptionsJobAction''. Values are:

        none - Take no action.

        disable - Disable the job. This is equivalent to calling the disable job

        API, with a disableTasks value of requeue.

        terminate - Terminate the job. The terminateReason in the job''s

        executionInfo is set to "TaskFailed". The default is none for exit code 0

        and terminate for all other exit conditions.

        If the job''s onTaskFailed property is noAction, then specifying this

        property returns an error and the add task request fails with an invalid

        property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP

        status code is 400 (Bad Request). Possible values include: ''none'',

        ''disable'', ''terminate''
