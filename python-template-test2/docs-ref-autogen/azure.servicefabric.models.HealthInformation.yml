        have health reports for different properties.

        The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter

        flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

        For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the

        state of the available disk on a node,

        so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

        The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a

        property "Connectivity" on the same node.

        In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events

        for the specified node.

        Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health

        information.

        frequency than time to live.

        If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to

        infinite.

        When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health

        information

        is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or

        evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.

        If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated.

        When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker

        The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred.

        If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value
