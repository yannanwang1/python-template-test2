  summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a partition should be

    included as a child of a service in the cluster health chunk.

    The partitions are only returned if the parent entities match a filter

    specified in the cluster health chunk query description. The parent service

    and application must be included in the cluster health chunk.

    One filter can match zero, one or multiple partitions, depending on its

    properties.

    - description: 'ID of the partition that matches the filter.

        The filter is applied only to the specified partition, if it exists.

        If the partition doesn''t exist, no partition is returned in the cluster

        health chunk based on this filter.

        If the partition exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if it

        respects the other filter properties.

        If not specified, all partitions that match the parent filters (if any)

        are taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members,

        like health state filter.

    - description: 'The filter for the health state of the

        partitions. It allows selecting partitions if they match the desired

        health states.

        The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

        states. Only partitions that match the filter are returned. All partitions

        are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

        If not specified, default value is None, unless the partition id is

        specified. If the filter has default value and partition id is specified,

        the matching partition is returned.

        The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a

        combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

        For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches partitions with

        HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

        - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

        - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

        return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

        - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

        2.

        - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

        value is 4.

        - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

        value is 8.

        - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is

        65535.

        For example, it can specify a filter to return all replicas with health

        state Error and another filter to always include a replica identified by

        its replica id.
