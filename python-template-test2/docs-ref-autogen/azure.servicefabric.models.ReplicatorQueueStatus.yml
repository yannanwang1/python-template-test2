  summary: 'Provides various statistics of the queue used in the service fabric

    replicator.

    Contains information about the service fabric replicator like the

    replication/copy queue utilization, last acknowledgement received

    timestamp, etc.

    Depending on the role of the replicator, the properties in this type imply

    different meanings.
